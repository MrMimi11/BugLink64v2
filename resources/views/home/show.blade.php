    <p>Hi, this is Mr. Mimi. I am the creator of this site and I hope you will like it. It's my first site that I make so don't be too mean^^ and I know that there can be bugs and things to improve. </p>
    The site is to gather all the bugs of Zelda ocarina of time and Zelda Majora's Mask instead of searching on youtube. I chose to make Ocarina of time and Majora's Mask because they are good games (and these 2 games are on Nintendo 64 and on 3ds but here I focus on the Nintendo 64 version) and I played them a lot too.
    With the site you will be able to post your strats if you have created an account and see other strats that people have posted ðŸ‘€
